A locker room is a place containing lockers where people can leave their 
belongings and pick them up later. Lockers can be found, for example, in 
changing rooms at the gym or in the sports hall. An automatic locker system has 
been introduced in the locker room. When a client visits the room, the system 
works as follows:
◦ if the client has no locker assigned, the system assigns them a free locker 
    with the lowest available number;

◦ if the client has a locker assigned, the system opens and frees the locker. 
    After this, the locker can be reassigned to another client.

Lockers are numbered from 1. At the beginning of the day, all lockers are free.
The locker room is visited N times. Which locker was the last one assigned to 
some client?

Write a function:

int solution (vector<string> &clients);

that, given an array clients consisting of N strings of client names, 
representing the order in which the clients visited the locker room, returns the
number of the last assigned locker.

Examples:

1. For clients = ["Alice", "Eve", "Bob", "Eve", "Carl", "Alice"],
the following events happened:

◦ locker 1 was assigned to Alice;

◦ locker 2 was assigned to Eve;

◦ locker 3 was assigned to Bob;

◦ Eve freed locker 2;

◦ locker 2 was assigned to Carl;

◦ Alice freed locker 1.

The last locker was assigned to Carl, so the function should return 2.

2. For clients = ["Alice", "Bob", "Bobby"], 
the function should return 3.

3. For clients = ["Bob", "bob", "BoB", "bob", "BOB"], 
the function should return 2, because lowercase letters should be distinguished 
from uppercase letters.

4. For clients = ["Alice", "Alice", "Bob", "Alice], the function should return 2.

Assume that:

◦ N is an integer within the range [3..300];

◦ each string in the array clients consists of at most 20 English letters (A'-Z, 'a'-z').

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will 
not be the focus of the assessment.
