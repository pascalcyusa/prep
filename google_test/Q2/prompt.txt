There are N consecutive measurements (numbered from 0 to N-1) taken by a health 
monitoring device. During the K-th measurement, the device recorded heartRate[K]
and activityLevel|K (possible levels are "Low", "Normal" or "High").

What is the largest difference between the highest and lowest values of the 
heart rate during a single period of the same activity level?

Write a function:

int solution(vector<int> &heartRate, vector<string> &activityLevel);

that, given an array of integers heartRate and an array of strings activityLevel, 
both of length N, returns the largest difference between the highest and lowest 
values of the heart rate during a single period of the same activity level.

Examples:

1. Assume that heartRate = [60, 100, 90, 80]
and activityLevel = ["Low", "High", "High", "High"]. 
There is only one measurement during the "Low" activity level, so its difference 
is 0. There are three measurements during the "High" activity level, and the 
difference between the highest and lowest heart rates equals 20. The function 
should return 20.

2. Assume that heartRate = [82, 120, 78, 61]
and activityLevel = ["Normal", "High", "Normal", "Low"]. 
All activity periods of the same level are of length 1, so the function should 
return 0.

3. For heartRate = [100, 87, 90, 90, 125]

and activityLevel = ['"Normal", "Normal", "Normal", "High", "Low'], 
the function should return 13.

Assume that:

◦ N is an integer within the range [1, 100];

◦ each element of array heartRate is an integer within the range [40, 200];

◦ each element of array activityLevel is a string that can have one of the 
following values: Low, Normal, High.
